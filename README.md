### This course is the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate as well as the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization
Working with SpaceX data in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, 
data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting results.   

Predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; 
other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. [Applied Data Science Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone)
